This is a paragraph.
This is another paragraph which gets with inline(along side) of the previous content because we've marked a break line between two paragraphs.

1.Paragraphs:

                <BreakLine: ENTER>
                    <Paragraph>
                <BreakLine: ENTER>

2.Text Decoration:

we can either use `'*'` or `'_'` notation to decorate texts:

     *<text>*  => Italic
    **<text>** => Bold

     _<text>_  => Italic
    __<text>__ => Bold

    ~~<text>~~ => Strikethrough



Bottom Line: 
                One Set - Italic
                Two Set - Bold
